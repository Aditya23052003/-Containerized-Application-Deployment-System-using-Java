# -Containerized-Application-Deployment-System-using-Java

Project Overview:
This project involves creating a containerized deployment system for Java applications using Docker. The system can take a Java application, containerize it, and deploy it in a Docker environment. It includes features like continuous integration and monitoring.

Features:

Automated containerization of Java applications
Deployment of containers to Docker
Basic health monitoring of deployed containers
Rollback in case of failed deployments
Technologies:

Java (Maven, Spring Boot)
Docker CLI integration
Jenkins for CI/CD
REST API for interacting with Docker
Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

Report Outline:

Introduction: The role of containerization in modern system engineering.
Objectives: Automate the containerization and deployment of Java applications using Docker.
System Design: Explain the architecture, including Docker CLI interaction, Java code for building, deploying, and monitoring containers.
Implementation: Detail the steps to containerize and deploy a Java application, using Maven for build and Docker for deployment.
Testing: Discuss the test scenarios like successful deployment, container monitoring, and rollback mechanisms.
Conclusion: Highlight the ease of deploying and managing applications in a containerized environment.
